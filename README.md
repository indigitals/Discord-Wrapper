## About the Project
This (will) be a wrapper for the discord websocket geared torwards selfbots (automating user accounts) and the less documented aspects of the discord websocket (eg lazy guilds). This is mainly an experiment so I can get more used to discord's websocket for a future project.

## Plans
Currently my goal with this is to provide an easy way to use the discord websocket. I have yet to successfully connect to the websocket though so thats the next step :p
